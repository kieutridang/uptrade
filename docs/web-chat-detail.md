## Option 2: Chat about an item

Eg: I am a customer and I want to ask a question about the product.

1. We need to add another field into Supplier/Customer management: “Send messages to”

2. When users from this customer/supplier will send messages, they will be sent to the user selected. For instance for a customer, the company will choose the dedicated sales manager. If no user selected: workspace admin(s) receive the message.

3. When a user is on a product sheet, it opens the message panel with the name of the product + item # as a message title.
   
   A. Option 1: from the same company: sends a message to the product manager. If no product manager is selected in the sheet, it’s the creator of the product by default.

   B. Option 2: the user is from another company (supplier/customer) and wants to ask a question. Then recipient is the user selected by the company in the supplier/customer settings. (see point #1).

4. Then the message appears in the chat list with the product as subject.
