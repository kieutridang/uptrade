UpTrade Cloud ERP is a software solution designed to improve trading companies’ operations.

**Definition**: a *trading company* is an intermediary between factories/suppliers and retailers. They buy products from suppliers and sell/export them to their customers. Many trading companies are established in Asia. From there they can monitor the production, source new products and provide export service for worldwide retailers.

UpTrade Cloud connects all parties: buyers, middlemen and suppliers. Specific features are designed for each step of the supply chain process and for these different stakeholders. They can all interact together within the platform to chat about products, place order, and share details about supply and products. Our ultimate goal is to build a platform where users can share products, buy and receive them without writing a single email.

### SOURCING WITH UPTRADE

*For buyers*: buyers working for retailers want to save the products they find during trade show visits, factories tour, or even if they find a product in another shop. Users can save their product details and send Request For Quotes to their existing supplier.

*For trading companies*: they have to be aware of new trends and offer the newest items possible to the buyers they are working with. These novelties are stored in their UpTrade space, and they can share these products directly with the buyers they are working with, margin included.

*For suppliers*: factories can receive the Request For Quotes directly on the platform. If they already have product details stored, they can push it and do almost no data entry.

### IMPORTING & EXPORTING GOODS WITH UPTRADE

*For buyers*: buyers to follow up their open orders. They can validate inspection reports, shipping documents, and all other necessary steps to complete shipment, directly from the platform.

*For trading companies*: this is the core of the software solution. Trading Companies enter and use all the details they have about suppliers, their products and the orders they have in their sales book. UpTrade Cloud is a comprehensive ERP with exclusive features for trading companies to avoid double data entry, being consistent in their processes, and smoothen their offering, ordering and selling process.

*For suppliers*: factories also follow up on the orders placed by the trading companies. They can offer their permanent items from there and receive orders. We make sure they don’t forget to produce the order and that they save time on editing shipping documents or internal inspection reports.

### OPERATIONS WITH UPTRADE

*For trading companies*: trading companies are mainly SMEs, they often don’t have the tools to offer their items online or improve their relationship with their customers. UpTrade Cloud provides simple tools with lean features to integrate all their operations: HR, CRM, Web Shop and finance integration.
