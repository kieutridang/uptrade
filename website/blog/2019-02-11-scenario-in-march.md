**Đây là kịch bản của Antoine muốn team mình ưu tiên làm:**
Hi team, this is the general workflow of what is about to happen in a month time. Making this possible is our *#1 priority*, more than the other features.

1. First, 2 users download the app: 1 from the google play store + 1 from the Apple store
2. First user creates a company under the ID "DML" and fills in the company profile. He becomes the admin and invites the other user to register. Once done, the other user logs in the mobile app.
3.  One of the users create an event called " ECF2019". The event manager invites the other user (they are from the same company).
4. In the mobile app settings, they configure the fields they want to have when they click on "+" / add a new products. They don't want to see all the fields available, just the ones they will use for every product sheet for sure.
5. They travel to Shanghai to the show with their mobiles where they will have no internet access.
6. They visit a supplier booth with many products, they want to create a product sheet for some of them (they still don't have internet so the product sheet must be stored locally):
- First they enter the details about the supplier: name, maybe the email and a picture of the business card
- then they take pictures of the item, write the name and the price, sometimes a description and select the supplier they just created
- they save their first product and add another one by pressing "+", the name of the previous supplier is autoselected.
7. They visit another booth and repeat: create the supplier + create one or more products from this supplier
8.  Once they get on WiFi, the app suggests to sync the products.
9. At the end of the show, they access the Event product list. Where everything is listed and do a short selection.
